User parameters
===============
G_ENaC (apical ENaC conductance)
G_CFTR (apical CFTR conductance, only striated duct)
G_CaCC (apical CaCC conductance, only intercalated duct)
G_BK (apical Maxi-K conductance)
G_K_B (basolateral K+ conductance)
G_Na_B (basolateral Na+ conductance)
G_Cl_B (basolateral Cl- conductance)
NKA_alpha_B (basolateral NaK ATPase density)
G_P_Cl (tight-junctional Cl- conductance)
L_A (apical water permeability)
L_B (basolateral water permeability)

And here are some additional parameters which, if changed, could potentially lead to unphysiological results.
G_P_Na (tight-junctional Na+ conductance)
G_P_K (tight-junctional K+ conductance)


Changes to code 
===============
Striated_Duct_Method_of_Lines => MiniGland/duct:

- move ini2struct.m up one directory
- get_parameters.m
    comment out line 46 addpath 
    % get the interactive user adjustments to parameters from GUI
    % intercalated
    % striated
- main_script.m
    load("../acinus/" + acinus_data_file); % get concentration of Primary Saliva from acinus simulation
    PS = [time_series.Na(1); time_series.K(1); time_series.Cl(1); time_series.HCO(1); time_series.H(1); 1.28];
    %{comment out sanity check, electroneutrality check, plots%}
- dynamic_script.m
    %load("Acinus PDE Results\result_bicarb_smooth_VPLC0.002.mat")
    % NOTE: time_series has already been loaded in the main_script
    %cell_prop{x(i)}.type
    %{comment out plots%}
    Rename step -> tstep

Acinus data
===========
- primary saliva data = (time, Q, Na, K, Cl, HCO, H)
**** What are Q and H?
- initial concentrations = (0, 11.91, 136.95, 6.8, 115.3, 28.47, 7.726e-05)
- 500s total time
- stimulation ON at 0s, OFF at 400s


Adjustable Parameters
=====================
**** What parameters? 
From in-vivo, ex-vivo?


Duct with primary saliva from stimulated acinus
=============================================== 
**** acinus data steady state is always first value, then stimulation
**** simplified duct model with time-varying acinus data??? 
**** dynamic_script runs after main_script because main script calcs duct steady state
- could duct steady state saved as precompute to enable faster duct parameter exploration 
**** acinus data could have single time step (for duct steady calcs only) 

Duct data
=========
- 1000s total time
**** Why?  - runs 2x longer than acinus data



Duct simulation running times
=============================
precompute structure: 60s
+ steady state inversion (full model): 95s
+ dynamic data inversion: 631s

Full with GUI: 5m 39s
